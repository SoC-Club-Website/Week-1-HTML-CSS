<h2> Getting Started</h2>
  Go through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU6anWqZJcc">this</a> complete video to get a comprehensive knowledge about HTML and CSS.<br>
  While it may seem a very large video, its actually quite basic and you can easily watch it on 2x, further the most imp section is from 13:58 to 10:13:36, hence basically 5 hrs or 1 hr per day.
